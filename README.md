# pmc - Python

Parse full text XML documents from PubMed Central's Open Access subset into structured data.

This is a complete rewrite in Python that achieves similar functionality to [tidypmc](https://github.com/ropensci/tidypmc) but which can generate Markdown.

## Examples

You can extract from a single XML file: `python extract_from_xml.py`

Or you can extract all XML files from a TAR file: `python extract_from_tar.py`
